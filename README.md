# Would you rather App

## Installing Nodejs, setting up the package manager and installing the dependencies

Running and using the app is very straight forward, just follow the instructions below.

First of all, make sure you have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Right after that, you can go ahead and install either [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) , so feel free to pick whichever you prefer.

Clicking either the `Yarn` or the `npm` links above will lead you to the corresponding instructions to set up whichever package manager you've picked.

Once you've installed those, go to the project folder via command line (in your terminal app) :
```cd your/path/here/would-you-rather-app ```

Then, run the following commands depending on which package manager you want to use, either `npm` or `yarn` , let's start with `npm` :

## npm

Since there's a `package.json` file in the directory, you have to run `npm install`. `npm` will look at the dependencies that are listed in that file and download the latest versions.

Then, once it finish, you can run the command below:
`npm start`

This will automatically opens a new tab in your default browser with a server running in the following location and port:

```http://localhost:3000/```
  
## Yarn

We need to use something like we did above with `npm` , but with `yarn` this time, of course. In this case, you'll need to run [`yarn install`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/install) , which is used to install all dependencies for the project. The dependencies are retrieved from the projectâ€™s `package.json` file, and stored in the `yarn.lock` file.

And then, once the process finish, run this command:
``` yarn start ```

This will automatically opens a new tab in your default browser with a server running in the following location and port:

```http://localhost:3000/```

These steps mentioned above should do the trick so you can use the Web App! :thumbsup:
